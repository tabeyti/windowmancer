# Windowmancer

Windowmancer is process-window management tool.

The application makes it easy for to locate a process-window on your desktop, set a custom size and location, and be able to invoke that configuration, for that window, on command.

Tired of the manual process of painstakingly re-positioning/re-sizing a common set of process-windows? Wish there was an easy way to easily gridify a collection of windows through the art Windomancy?! Windomancer is the solution!

## Use

Execute Windowmancer.exe. You'll see both the application icon appear in the system tray and the window editor populate on first run.

## Documentation

You can read the documentation [here](docs/DOCUMENTATION.md).
